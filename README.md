# OIBSIP_Task_2_customer-segmentation-analysis

Overview

The goal of this project is to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographic information. By using clustering techniques, we can identify distinct customer groups that share similar characteristics. These insights can then be used to tailor marketing efforts, enhance customer experiences, and optimize business strategies.

Data Description
The dataset used in this project contains customer information such as:

CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer
Age: Age of the customer
Gender: Gender of the customer
Annual Income: Annual income of the customer
Spending Score: Score assigned by the company based on customer behavior and spending nature

Data Preparation:

Use the data_preparation.py script to clean and preprocess the data.
Exploratory Data Analysis:

Utilize Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to explore the data and understand its structure.
Clustering Analysis:

Run the clustering.py script to perform clustering on the dataset.
Visualization:

Use the visualization.py script to generate visualizations of the clustering results.

Methodology
Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
Clustering Techniques:

Implement different clustering algorithms such as K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN.
Determine the optimal number of clusters using techniques like the Elbow Method and Silhouette Analysis.
Evaluation:

Evaluate the clustering results using metrics like Silhouette Score and Davies-Bouldin Index.
Visualization:

Visualize the clusters using scatter plots, dendrograms, and heatmaps.
Results
The results of the analysis will include:

Identified customer segments with distinct characteristics.
Insights into customer behavior and preferences.
Recommendations for targeted marketing strategies.
